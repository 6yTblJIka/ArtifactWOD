APPLICATION CONSOLE: Overview of the ClientPatcher Project
AppWizard has created this ClientPatcher application for you.

This file contains a summary of the contents of each of the files that make up your ClientPatcher application.

ClientPatcher.vcxproj
This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. It contains information about the version of Visual C++ used to generate the file, as well as information about the platforms, configurations, and project features you selected in the Application Wizard.

ClientPatcher.vcxproj.filters
This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. It contains information about the association between the files in your project and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to display the grouping of files with similar extensions under a specific node (e.g., ".cpp" files are associated with the "Source Files" filter).

ClientPatcher.cpp
This is the main source file of the application.

These files are used to generate a Precompiled Header (PCH) file ClientPatcher.pch and a precompiled type file named StdAfx.obj.
